# Draw-The-Word-Fong-Chung-Sir é»žå¯«æ–¹ä¸­sir

This parody Mini Game is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, built with Electron. Allows users to draw the word  "sir" in traditional Chinese. This "sir" character is not a real character in Traditional Chinese. Instead, it originates from the Hong Kong movie *Love Undercover* (æ–°ç´®å¸«å¦¹) 2002. In the movie, Chung Sir creates this unique Chinese "SIR" character as an excuse for a triad boss when trying to pass himself off as the "father" of Fong Lai-Kuan, needing to explain their different surnames.

Here, you will cosplay as Chung Sir, a.k.a. Fong Chung Sir, to write the character "sir" in Traditional Chinese. You still need to try and draw the character correctly! If your score is too low, the triads will know you are an Undercover police officerðŸ‘®!

Enjoy the game in either English or Traditional Chinese!
