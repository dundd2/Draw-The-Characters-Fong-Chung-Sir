## How to write the Traditional Chinese character "sir" in Fong Chung Sir style?

This is a parody webpage based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to draw the character "sir" in Traditional Chinese. This "sir" character is not a real character in Traditional Chinese. Instead, it originates from the 2002 movie *Love Undercover* (æ–°ç´®å¸«å¦¹). In the movie, Chung Sir creates this unique Chinese "SIR" character as an excuse to a triad boss when trying to pass himself off as the "father" of Fong Lai-Kuan, needing to explain their different surnames.

Here, you will cosplay as Chung Sir, a.k.a. Fong Chung Sir, to write the character "sir" in Traditional Chinese. You still need to try and draw the character correctly! If your score is too low, the triads will know you are a Undercover police officerðŸ‘®!
